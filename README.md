## Getting Started

Import the Maven project straight to your Java IDE:
- Intellij IDEA
- Spring Tool Suite (STS)
- Eclipse

_(OPTIONAL) To work with other RDBMS you need to configure the project 'application.properties' file match to your database URL, username, password and add a required Maven dependency._

## Technology Stack

- **REST**: [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)
- **Marshalling**: [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) (for JSON fromat)
- **Persistence**: [Spring Data JPA](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/) and [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/)
- **Databse**: [H2](http://www.h2database.com)
